# WanProtector - Password Manager Application
**Developer:** ILHAN IDRISS
**Platform:** Android

# What is WanProtector?
WanProtector is a standalone password manager app designed to securely store sensitive information such as username and password in an encrypted vault. Available on Google Play, it helps you manage your credentials safely and conveniently.

# How does WanProtector work?
To access the vault, users must create a **master password**—a unique key that protects all stored entries. Without this master password, access to the vault is permanently lost, ensuring that your data remains secure even if your device falls into the wrong hands.

Once inside the vault, users can create and manage entries—each containing essential information like usernames and passwords. These entries are always accessible to the user, especially when a password is forgotten.

# Does WanProtector requires an Internet connection?
Not at all. This app is **100% offline by default** — unless you choose to back up your vault to a cloud provider like Google Drive, which does require an internet connection.

# Why choose WanProtector?
WanProtector is designed to be both **user-friendly** and **secure**, offering a range of features to enhance your password management experience.
